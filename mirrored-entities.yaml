    **Version: 1.0**

    This automation allows to link the state of multiple entities.

    **The Automation Process:**
      - When you turn ANY linked entity ON, it will turn ON ALL linked entities.
      - When you turn ANY linked entity OFF, it will turn OFF ALL linked entities.

    **NOTE** - You can select any entity with an ON/OFF state (switches, lights, etc.)
