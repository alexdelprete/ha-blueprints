    **Linked Entities v1.2** ðŸ”›

    This blueprint allows you to easily create/maintain an automation that links the state of multiple entities:
      - turn ANY linked entity ON, it will turn ON ALL linked entities.
      - turn ANY linked entity OFF, it will turn OFF ALL linked entities.
      - set the brightness of any light entity, it will set the same brightness of ALL linked light entities.
      - set the color temp of any light entity, it will set the same color temperature of ALL linked light entities.
      - set the speed (percentage) of any fan entity, it will set the speed of ALL linked fan entities.

    **NOTE**: You can select any entity with an ON/OFF state (switches, lights, etc.), lights with brightness or color temperature attributes, and Fans with speed (percentage) attributes.

    My main use-case was for multiple light switches in the house controlling the same light, but I also use it for other things:
      - at dawn, when I turn on the external lights (a shelly switch), I also link the pool light mqtt switch.
      - when I want to open the external gate, I can use several linked switches in multiple rooms of the house
      - when I want to manually turn on/off the irrigation system, I use two switches (internal and external) to activate my RainMachine cycle

    I'm sure you'll find many more use-cases. :slight_smile:

    **CHANGELOG:**
      - 1.2: (2024-01-28 - thanks @phrak / @TimU for the PR)
        - Changed the action to a "Choose" building block to support fan, light and future attributes
        - Added support for linked fan speeds
        - Added support for linked light brightness and light color temperature
      - 1.1: (2024-01-09)
        - Optimized service call leveraging trigger.id
        - Introduced max_exceeded to avoid warnings in log due to possible self-triggering
        - Introduced a small delay after the service call to throttle the automation
      - 1.0: (2023-12-29)
        - First official release
