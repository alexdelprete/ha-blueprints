    ðŸ”› Linked Entities - v1.0

    This blueprint allows you to easily create/maintain an automation that links the state of multiple entities:
      - When you turn ANY linked entity ON, it will turn ON ALL linked entities.
      - When you turn ANY linked entity OFF, it will turn OFF ALL linked entities.

    NOTE: You can select any entity with an ON/OFF state (switches, lights, etc.)

    My main use-case was for multiple light switches in the house controlling the same light, but I also use it for other things:
      - at dawn, when I turn on the external lights (a shelly switch), I also link the pool light mqtt switch.
      - when I want to open the external gate, I can use several linked switches in 2-3 rooms of the house
      - when I want to manually turn on/off the irrigation system, I use two switches (internal and external) to activate my RainMachine cycle

    I'm sure you'll find many more examples. :slight_smile:
